  Today one of the things I learned is to assign to a variable the value a
user inputs through prompt.  

  Also I learned the if else. If else helped me with today's lab to do an alert
according to the input of the user.

  Like always, learned a few new things regarding CSS. There is always new
tricks and tips to be learned regarding CSS.
