# First Learning Journal.  

**Day 2**

  Today one of the things I learned is to assign to a variable the value a
user inputs through prompt.  

  Also I learned the if else. If else helped me with today's lab to do an alert
according to the input of the user.

  Like always, learned a few new things regarding CSS. There is always new
tricks and tips to be learned regarding CSS.

**Day 3**

  Today I learned something interesting about random numbers created by JS. The
random numbers you can get are just between 0 and 1 and all the decimals in the
middle. to actually get whole numbers we have to multiply it by a number. Let's
say we want a random number between 0 and 10. What I did is multiply the random
number JS gives me and I multiply it by 10. So this way 10 is the highest number
I can get.

  Also learned some cool css stuff. I learned how to have a fixed gif in the
background. If I scroll up or down gif stays static in the same position.

  I also got to have a lot of practice in loops and conditional statements.
