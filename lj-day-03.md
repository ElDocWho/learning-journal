# First Learning Journal.  

**Day 2**

  Today one of the things I learned is to assign to a variable the value a
user inputs through prompt.  

  Also I learned the if else. If else helped me with today's lab to do an alert
according to the input of the user.

  Like always, learned a few new things regarding CSS. There is always new
tricks and tips to be learned regarding CSS.

**Day 3**

  Today I learned something interesting about random numbers created by JS. The
random numbers you can get are just between 0 and 1 and all the decimals in the
middle. to actually get whole numbers we have to multiply it by a number. Let's
say we want a random number between 0 and 10. What I did is multiply the random
number JS gives me and I multiply it by 10. So this way 10 is the highest number
I can get.

  Also learned some cool css stuff. I learned how to have a fixed gif in the
background. If I scroll up or down gif stays static in the same position.

  I also got to have a lot of practice in loops and conditional statements.

**Day 4**

Day 4 the most important thing I learned is hoe the boxes work in the web page.
How to place them, how to give them attributes like with and height. Something
very important is how to float boxes. And regarding floating boxes how to
reset the float before getting to the next element in HTML so we do not have
to float that box.

**Day 5**

Today I learned a lot about functions and Arrays. The most interesting
part today was doing a function inside of a function.

Very interesting how arrays work and how can functions return multiple values
when acting as an array.

**Day 6**

  Today I learned how to do random number through through methods in Math.
Also I brushed up in some of my math to learn how to do the random number
method with integer limits.

  Also something very useful that I learned was to push data into n array using
a for loop.

  The creation of objects in a literal way was also learned today. We started a
project in which we are starting to use css. I learned how to insert a font
style into the web page from google fonts.

**Day 7**

  Today the main thing that I learned is how to create tables. We use different
tags. The first tag to start is <table>. After that one we want to create the
rows so we use <tr>. After that we want to create columns for the row or rows
we just created. <td> is used to create columns in the table.

  Of course rows and tables can have headings. The headings are done by a tag
same for the rows and the columns. The tag we use is a <th>.

**Day 8**

  Event handlers is what we covered in this class. The even handlers are used
to trigger something the the user does something with the key board, the mouse
or any other interacting interface device between the human and the laptop,
desktop, or any mobile device out there that uses a browser.

  The event handlers are assigned to an element. Then in the syntax we type what
kind of action is going to trigger the element. This could be a click, focus
blur, etc. There are many actions that can trigger the action. Then a function
assigned to the event handler or event listener trigger this function than will
perform a series of instructions.

**Day 9**

   We went over forms. How to get data from the user and how to use this data
in our methods. We continued with more css for the cookie stand. We also went
over the code for the cookie stand. Learned more about instances and how to
use methods to build a table with information. \

   It was pretty cool that we got lab time to finish the cookie stand and I got
a chance to research more css tricks. I learned actually have to give movement
to the salmon we have on sales.html.

**Day 9**

  Today I learned something related to deadlines. How companies give the  
developers deadlines to finish a project. Also learned a lot about css and the
way to implement it to a project with a deadline. Going over the cookie stand
code was very helpful.

   I read this morning about debugging and the major tools a developer has
to identify problems in the code. Also learned about testing, how it is done
and a general idea on how developers use testing apps to see if the code works
before it is shown to the client.
