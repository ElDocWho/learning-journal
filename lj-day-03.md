# First Learning Journal.  

**Day 2**

  Today one of the things I learned is to assign to a variable the value a
user inputs through prompt.  

  Also I learned the if else. If else helped me with today's lab to do an alert
according to the input of the user.

  Like always, learned a few new things regarding CSS. There is always new
tricks and tips to be learned regarding CSS.

**Day 3**

  Today I learned something interesting about random numbers created by JS. The
random numbers you can get are just between 0 and 1 and all the decimals in the
middle. to actually get whole numbers we have to multiply it by a number. Let's
say we want a random number between 0 and 10. What I did is multiply the random
number JS gives me and I multiply it by 10. So this way 10 is the highest number
I can get.

  Also learned some cool css stuff. I learned how to have a fixed gif in the
background. If I scroll up or down gif stays static in the same position.

  I also got to have a lot of practice in loops and conditional statements.

**Day 4**

Day 4 the most important thing I learned is hoe the boxes work in the web page.
How to place them, how to give them attributes like with and height. Something
very important is how to float boxes. And regarding floating boxes how to
reset the float before getting to the next element in HTML so we do not have
to float that box.

**Day 5**

Today I learned a lot about functions and Arrays. The most interesting
part today was doing a function inside of a function.

Very interesting how arrays work and how can functions return multiple values
when acting as an array.

**Day 6**

  Today I learned how to do random number through through methods in Math.
Also I brushed up in some of my math to learn how to do the random number
method with integer limits.

  Also something very useful that I learned was to push data into n array using
a for loop.

  The creation of objects in a literal way was also learned today. We started a
project in which we are starting to use css. I learned how to insert a font
style into the web page from google fonts.
