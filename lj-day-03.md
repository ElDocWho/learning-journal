# First Learning Journal.  

**Day 2**

  Today one of the things I learned is to assign to a variable the value a
user inputs through prompt.  

  Also I learned the if else. If else helped me with today's lab to do an alert
according to the input of the user.

  Like always, learned a few new things regarding CSS. There is always new
tricks and tips to be learned regarding CSS.

**Day 3**

  Today I learned something interesting about random numbers created by JS. The
random numbers you can get are just between 0 and 1 and all the decimals in the
middle. to actually get whole numbers we have to multiply it by a number. Let's
say we want a random number between 0 and 10. What I did is multiply the random
number JS gives me and I multiply it by 10. So this way 10 is the highest number
I can get.

  Also learned some cool css stuff. I learned how to have a fixed gif in the
background. If I scroll up or down gif stays static in the same position.

  I also got to have a lot of practice in loops and conditional statements.

**Day 4**

Day 4 the most important thing I learned is hoe the boxes work in the web page.
How to place them, how to give them attributes like with and height. Something
very important is how to float boxes. And regarding floating boxes how to
reset the float before getting to the next element in HTML so we do not have
to float that box.

**Day 5**

Today I learned a lot about functions and Arrays. The most interesting
part today was doing a function inside of a function.

Very interesting how arrays work and how can functions return multiple values
when acting as an array.

**Day 6**

  Today I learned how to do random number through through methods in Math.
Also I brushed up in some of my math to learn how to do the random number
method with integer limits.

  Also something very useful that I learned was to push data into n array using
a for loop.

  The creation of objects in a literal way was also learned today. We started a
project in which we are starting to use css. I learned how to insert a font
style into the web page from google fonts.

**Day 7**

  Today the main thing that I learned is how to create tables. We use different
tags. The first tag to start is <table>. After that one we want to create the
rows so we use <tr>. After that we want to create columns for the row or rows
we just created. <td> is used to create columns in the table.

  Of course rows and tables can have headings. The headings are done by a tag
same for the rows and the columns. The tag we use is a <th>.

**Day 8**

  Event handlers is what we covered in this class. The even handlers are used
to trigger something the the user does something with the key board, the mouse
or any other interacting interface device between the human and the laptop,
desktop, or any mobile device out there that uses a browser.

  The event handlers are assigned to an element. Then in the syntax we type what
kind of action is going to trigger the element. This could be a click, focus
blur, etc. There are many actions that can trigger the action. Then a function
assigned to the event handler or event listener trigger this function than will
perform a series of instructions.

**Day 9**

   We went over forms. How to get data from the user and how to use this data
in our methods. We continued with more css for the cookie stand. We also went
over the code for the cookie stand. Learned more about instances and how to
use methods to build a table with information. \

   It was pretty cool that we got lab time to finish the cookie stand and I got
a chance to research more css tricks. I learned actually have to give movement
to the salmon we have on sales.html.

**Day 10**

  Today I learned something related to deadlines. How companies give the  
developers deadlines to finish a project. Also learned a lot about css and the
way to implement it to a project with a deadline. Going over the cookie stand
code was very helpful.

   I read this morning about debugging and the major tools a developer has
to identify problems in the code. Also learned about testing, how it is done
and a general idea on how developers use testing apps to see if the code works
before it is shown to the client.   

**Day 11**

  Today we basically learned about videos and how to embed them in our web page.
Flash is one that caught my attention. To me it seems like the easiest way to
embed video. Too bad it is not going to last long because Apple is not using it
anymore.

  We also learned about the <video> tag. This is a new tag, so not all the
browsers support it. A disadvantage of this tag is that it does not support
Digital Rights Management.

**Day 12**

  Today we learned about canvas and how to create charts. the <canvas> tag is
basically another box which creates an area in which we will draw.We also
learned about libraries and how to use them in our program. Libraries are just
scripts created by other developed which we can use in our programs to make
things faster.

  A clear example of using libraries is charts.js. Charts js helps us create
a chart with data we have. It can be many different kinds of charts: pie, bar,
doughnut, etc. This facilitates the creation of charts a lot. A lot less
commands to create a chart.

**Day 13 **

  today basically the most important thing we learned a is local storage. We
learned how local storage works and how to use it. It can be use in most of our
application when not using a database.

  We used the JSON command to store data in the local storage. Through JSON we
stringified  an Array. Then we store the Array in local storage in the
data type of a string. To get this string out of the local storage we used JSON
again. We parse the string and it goes back to the data type of Array.

  Doing all this seems like a lot of code just to store an Array but it is
needed. The values persist even if u reload the browser or even x out of it. Of
course when using enormous amounts of that we need to use a database instead
of local storage.

***Day 14**

  Today we went over animations in css. We learned about transforms, There are
two types of transforms, 2D and 3D. In 2D we can scale, rotate, translate and
skew. The syntax is as follows:

div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}

In 3D we can use also scale, rotate, translate and skew.

  We also learned animations through keyframes. Here is an example of keyframes:

  @-webkit-keyframes bouncing {
    40%, 70%, 90% {
      bottom: 0;
      -webkit-animation-timing-function: ease-out;
    }

**Day 15**

  The highlight of today was jQuery. We learned about libraries and how to use
them. jQuery makes life easier and we use less code in many cases. Of course
sometimes will be easier to use vanilla JS.

**Day 16**

  I learned and improved my knowledge on how to work in a group to wireframe
a web page with a group. I also learned and improved how to merge together with
my team and fix merging conflicts.
